# Portfolio-Optimizer
Portfolio optimizer written in Python using Pandas, SciPy, NumPy and CVXPY.

Version 1 is a simple portfolio optimizer in Python to determine the most efficient allocation of assets to maximize profits.

Version 2 is a portfolio optimizer using Python to maximize portfolio return while limiting down-side risk. Algorithm makes improvements on Modern Portfolio Theory, 
such as by using the Sortino Ratio instead of Sharpeâ€™s Ratio to differentiate harmful volatility from total volatility. Metrics for measuring success involve using
a Monte Carlo simulation to determine profits over time.
